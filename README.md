üìà Trading Strategy Backtesting & Simulation:
 General Idea of the Project
Implements and tests algorithmic trading strategies using Python

Uses technical indicators such as:
Average Directional Index (ADX)
Stochastic Oscillator
Moving Averages (MA)
Bollinger Bands (BB)
Commodity Channel Index (CCI)

Includes a refinement algorithm to improve entry/exit signals with volatility filters

Provides a backtesting framework to measure:
Portfolio returns
Sharpe Ratio (risk-adjusted return)
Maximum drawdown (largest loss from a peak)
Features a paper-trading simulation to mimic real-time trading without risk

Adds a leaderboard system to rank strategies by simulated profitability
